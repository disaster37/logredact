# Logrus Secret Remover Hook

Logredact is a Logrus hook for removing sensitive information from log entries. This module can help you protect secrets in your logs by redacting them before the logs are written.

## Installation

To install the `logredact`, run the following command:

```sh
go get github.com/disaster37/logredact
```

## Usage

To use the logredact, import it in your Go code and add it to your Logrus logger. Here's an example:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/disaster37/logredact"
	"github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
)

func main() {
	logger := logrus.New()

	secrets := []string{"supersecret", "anothersecret", `password=.*`}
	secretHook := logredact.New(secrets, "***")

	logger.AddHook(secretHook)

	logger.Info("This log entry contains a supersecret token.")
}

```

In this example, we create a new Logrus logger, create a new secret remover hook with a list of secrets to redact, and add the hook to the logger. When we log an entry containing one of the secrets, the hook will replace the secret with `***`.

Example with Go structure logging:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/sirupsen/logrus"
	"github.com/disaster37/logredact"
)

type MyStruct struct {
	Username string
	Password string
}

func main() {
	logger := logrus.New()
	logger.SetFormatter(&logrus.JSONFormatter{})

	secrets := []string{"mysecret1", "mysecret2"}

	hook := logredact.New(secrets)
	
	logger.AddHook(hook)

	logger.Info("This is a log entry with mysecret1 and mysecret2")

	myData := MyStruct{
		Username: "myuser",
		Password: "mysecret1",
	}

	// Logging an object with sensitive data using WithFields
	logger.WithFields(logrus.Fields{
		"my_struct": myData,
	}).Info("Logging a Go struct with sensitive data")
}

```

## Configuration

The logredact takes an array of strings as first argument and `replacer` as the second argument. These strings represent the secrets you want to remove from your log entries. You can add as many secrets as needed:

```go
secrets := []string{"secret1", "secret2", "secret3"}
secretHook := logredact.New(secrets, "***")
```
